# Getting Started

**Python-cookiecutter** is a tool that helps you quickly set up a Python
project with everything needed to publish it in a very easy steps on GitHub and
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

It automatically creates a structured project and sets up essential
tools, including:

-   A blank `README.md` file for documentation.
-   A `LICENSE` file to define usage rights.
-   [Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to maintain code
    quality.
-   Automatic versioning with
    [setuptools_scm](https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
-   A test setup using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/).
-   Automated formatting, testing, and publishing via [GitHub
    Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
-   A documentation setup with
    [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
