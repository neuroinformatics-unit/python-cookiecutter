Getting Started
===============

**python-cookiecutter** is a tool that helps you quickly set up a Python project with everything needed to publish it on GitHub and `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_.

It automatically creates a structured project and sets up essential tools, including:

- A blank ``README.md`` file for documentation.
- A ``LICENSE`` file to define usage rights.
- `Pre-commit hooks <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to maintain code quality.
- Automatic versioning with `setuptools_scm <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm>`_.
- A test setup using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/>`_.
- Automated formatting, testing, and publishing via `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`_.
- A documentation setup with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.

This tool is based on `cookiecutter-napari-plugin <https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin>`_ and provides a solid starting point for your projects.
